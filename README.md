# Smart Room Management System

A multi-role web platform for booking meeting rooms, managing meetings, and capturing Minutes of Meeting (MoM) within organizations.

Built as part of a real-world internship project to streamline room scheduling, meeting coordination, and post-meeting documentation across teams.

## Problem

In many organizations, meeting room booking, meeting coordination, and documentation are handled through disconnected tools,
emails, or spreadsheets. This leads to double bookings, lack of visibility, and inconsistent follow-up
on decisions and action items.

Teams waste time coordinating logistics instead of focusing on outcomes, and important context from meetings is often lost
across personal notes and messaging tools.
