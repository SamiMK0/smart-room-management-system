# Smart Room Management System

A multi-role web platform for booking meeting rooms, managing meetings, and capturing Minutes of Meeting (MoM) within organizations.

Built as part of a real-world internship project to streamline room scheduling, meeting coordination, and post-meeting documentation across teams.

## Problem

In many organizations, meeting room booking, meeting coordination, and documentation are handled through disconnected tools,
emails, or spreadsheets. This leads to double bookings, lack of visibility, and inconsistent follow-up
on decisions and action items.


## Solution

This platform centralizes room booking, meeting management, and Minutes of Meeting into a single system with clear workflows
and role-based access. It provides room availability, meeting details, and post-meeting outcomes,
helping teams coordinate more efficiently and maintain consistent documentation across the organization.

By bringing scheduling, meetings, and follow-ups into one place, the system reduces coordination overhead, prevents conflicts,
and improves visibility for both users and administrators.

## Key Capabilities

- Role-based access with separate experiences for administrators and end users
- End-to-end room booking workflows with availability checks and scheduling controls
- Meeting management with agendas, attendees, and structured Minutes of Meeting (MoM)
- Administrative management for rooms, users, and booking activity with operational visibility

## Technologies Used

- Backend: Laravel (RESTful APIs for authentication, room booking, meetings, and MoM workflows), tested using Postman
- Frontend: React with Tailwind CSS for building responsive, role-based user interfaces
- Database: MySQL for relational data storage
